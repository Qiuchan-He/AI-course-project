/**
 * @brief A NoMystery problem is a logistics task in which a truck must gather
 * and deliver packages to a specific locations, under the constraint that the
 * load of the truck may not exceed a specific capacity C (max. number of
 * packages).
 *
 * There are three kinds of actions:
 *
 * 1. The trucker may drive from one location l to another location l', if l is
 * connected to l'. In general, there may be one-way roads, i.e., l is connected
 * to l' but not vice versa.
 * 2. The trucker may load a package if both are at the same location and the
 * loading capacity of the truck has not been reached yet. This increases the
 * load by 1.
 * 3. The trucker may unload a package at his location. This decreases the
 * load by 1.
 *
 * This environment is modelled as an FDR task as follows:
 *
 * Variables:
 * + Truck-At - position of the truck, one of the locations.
 * + Load - number of packages currently loaded from 0 to C (inclusive).
 * + Package-At(p) - position of a package p, either a location or 'truck'.
 *
 * Operators:
 * + Drive(l, l') - The truck drives from location l to location l'. The
 *   operator only exists for some l and l' if l is connected to l'.
 *   - Precondition: Truck-At=l
 *   - Effect: Truck=l'
 * + Load-Package(l, p, c) - Loads the package p at location l when the truck
 * has a load of c < C.
 *   - Precondition: Truck-At=l, Package-At=l, Load=c
 *   - Effect: Package-At=truck, Load=c+1
 * + Unload-Package(l, p, c) - Unloads the package p at location l when the
 *   truck has a load of c > 0.
 *   - Precondition: Truck-At=l, Package-At(p)=truck, Load=c
 *   - Effect: Package-At=l, Load=c-1
 *
 * All operators have unit costs by default, but can be configured to have
 * different costs as well. See constructor arguments for details.
