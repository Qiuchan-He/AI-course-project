/**
 * @brief Sokoban is a single-player puzzle game taking place in a 2D grid with
 * fixed width and height with walls and crates (link to a web version:
 * https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/sokoban.html). In the following, we denote
 * the set of coordinates in the grid that are not inhabited by a wall as the
 * "play area". The task of this game is to push all crates into designated goal
 * positions within the play area. As soon as every crate is on a goal position,
 * the puzzle is solved.
 *
 * There are two kinds of actions the player character can do:
 *
 * 1. The player character may move from one square in the play area to another
 * horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally adjacent square inside the
 * play area, unless the square is blocked by a crate.
 * 2. The player character can push a horizontally or vertically, but not
 * diagonally adjacent crate forward by one square, unless the square behind the
 * crate is blocked by another crate or not inside the playarea. Doing so also
 * moves the player character forward by one square in the same direction.
 *
 * Notably, a crate cannot be dragged sideways or pulled, which produces
 * situations in which the puzzle becomes unsolvable.
 *
 * This environment is modelled as an FDR task as follows:
 *
 * Variables:
 * + Player-At - position of the player, a 2D coordinate inside the play area.
 * + Crate-At(c) - position of a crate c, a 2D coordinate inside the play area.
 * + Crate-At-Goal(c) - whether a crate c is on some goal square. True or false.
 * + Square-Clear(x, y) - whether the play area position <x, y> is occupied by a
 * crate. True or false.
 *
 * Here, we assume "image coordinates", i.e., the x-axis goes from left-to-right
 * and the y-axis goes from top to bottom for the 2D grid coordinates. The
 * coordinate <0, 0> therefore designates the top-left corner of the grid.
 *
 * Operators:
 * + Move-Left(x, y) - The player character moves left by one square.
 *   Only exists if the square <x-1, y> is inside the play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Square-Clear(x-1, y)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x-1, y>
 * + Move-Up(x, y) - The player character moves up by one square.
 *   Only exists if the square <x, y-1> is inside the play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Square-Clear(x, y-1)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x, y-1>
 * + Move-Right(x, y) - The player character moves right by one square.
 *   Only exists if the square <x+1, y> is inside the play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Square-Clear(x+1, y)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x+1, y>
 * + Move-Down(x, y) - The player character moves down by one square.
 *   Only exists if the square <x, y+1> is inside the play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Square-Clear(x, y+1)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x, y+1>
 * + Push-Left(c, x, y) - The player character pushes a crate c to his left by
 *   one square. Only exists if the squares <x-1, y> and <x-2, y> are inside the
 *   play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x-1, y>,
 *                   Square-Clear(x-2, y)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x-1, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x-2, y>,
 *             Square-Clear(x-2, y)=false,
 *             Crate-At-Goal(c)= | true   if <x-2, y> is a goal position
 *                               | false  otherwise
 * + Push-Up(c, x, y) - The player character pushes a crate c above him by one
 *   square. Only exists if the squares <x, y-1> and <x, y-2> are inside the
 *   play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x, y-1>,
 *                   Square-Clear(x, y-2)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x, y-1>, Crate-At(c)=<x, y-1>,
 *             Square-Clear(x, y-2)=false,
 *             Crate-At-Goal(c)= | true   if <x, y-2> is a goal position
 *                               | false  otherwise
 * + Push-Right(c, x, y) - The player character pushes a crate c to his right by
 *   one square. Only exists if the squares <x+1, y> and <x+2, y> are inside the
 *   play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x+1, y>,
 *                   Square-Clear(x+2, y)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x+1, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x+2, y>,
 *             Square-Clear(x+2, y)=false,
 *             Crate-At-Goal(c)= | true   if <x+2, y> is a goal position
 *                               | false  otherwise
 * + Push-Down(c, x, y) - The player character pushes a crate c below him by one
 *   square. Only exists if the squares <x, y+1> and <x, y+2> are inside the
 *   play area.
 *   - Precondition: Player-At=<x, y>, Crate-At(c)=<x, y+1>,
 *                   Square-Clear(x, y+2)=true
 *   - Effect: Player-At=<x, y+1>, Crate-At(c)=<x, y+2>,
 *             Square-Clear(x, y+2)=false,
 *             Crate-At-Goal(c)= | true   if <x, y+2> is a goal position
 *                               | false  otherwise
 *
